<!--Add an attribute to make browsers display some default controls.
Add some appropriate fallback text for browsers that don't support <video>.
Add multiple sources, containing the paths to the video files. The files are called video.mp4 and video.webm, and are in a folder inside the current folder called media.
Let the browser know in advance what video formats the sources point to, so it can make an informed choice of which one to download ahead of time.
Give the <video> a width and height equal to its intrinsic size (320 by 240 pixels).
Make the video muted by default.
Display the text tracks contained in the media folder, in a file called subtitles_en.vtt, when the video is playing. You must explicitly set the type as subtitles, and the subtitle language to English.
Make sure the readers can identify the subtitle language when they use the default controls.-->
